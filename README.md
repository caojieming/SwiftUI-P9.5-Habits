# SwiftUI-P9.5-Habits
Hacking With Swift Day 47 Milestone (projects 7-9)

A simple habit-tracking app for people who want to keep track of how much they do certain things.

---

List of Features:
- Create habits + descriptions and show them in a list on the main page
- Delete habits from main page by swiping
- Can add (or subtract) completion times for each habit
- Data for all habits are stored using Codable and UserDefaults so that closing the app does not reset the list
