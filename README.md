# SwiftUI-P9.5-Habits
Hacking With Swift Day 47 Milestone (projects 7-9)

A simple habit-tracking app for people who want to keep track of how much they do certain things.

Create habits + descriptions and show them in a list on the main page. Can add (or subtract) completion times for each habit. Data for all habit are stored so that closing the app does not reset the list.
